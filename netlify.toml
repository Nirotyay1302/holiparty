# Spectra HoliParty - Netlify Configuration
# Note: This is a Flask (Python) app. Netlify primarily hosts static sites.
# For full functionality, deploy the backend to Render (https://render.com) - free tier supports Python/Flask.
# Then update the API URL in your frontend or use Netlify for static assets only.
